                <h2>Brainstorm process summary</h2>
                <p>My brainstorming was not as productive as I had hoped. At first, I focused on brainstorming about what problems exist in term of inclusiveness, respect, and reciprocity, in hopes of being inspired by the those constrainst to find a solution. However, this approach just made me sad and unmotivated. On the plus side, I do have a sizable idea base to pull from in terms of what I can work on solving.</p>
                <p>Overall, problems with the environment and sustainability resonated the most with me, and were thus the easiest to brainstorm about. One idea that came from that was maybe making a website that would help people make more sustainable choices and develop more respect for the planet. Respect for the environment and working to combat global warming is part of respecting people. By making the world a better place and improving its condition, we show respect for not only the environment, but also the people who live in it, particularly the younger and future generation that will inherit the effects of the actions we take today. Just as littering in a public area disrespects the people who work there and use that space, being unsustainable disrespects the everyone on the planet, since one way or another, all people will be affected by climate change and other global environmental problems. Maybe, by creating a community of respect for the environment, people will be encouraged to make better choices. In addition, perhaps reciprocity could be encouraged by having a system of accountability between people about making sustainable choices. Another way would be to find a way to emphasize experiences over material goods, and hopefully inspire more social connections between people.</p>
                <p>Another thing I brainstormed about was the problem of fake news and manipulation of the media. This is a problem for respect and inclusiveness, since it shows a fundamental disrespect for the consumers of such media. However, I was unable to think of anything to use as a solution besides informing people and helping them check the validity of sources and analyze media critically.</p>
