                <h2>Sketching process summary</h2>

                <p>The sketching process was particularly helpful in shifting my thinking from more abstract concepts about features and interactivity to how these would actually appear on the page and be used in practice. I found it a bit difficult to translate my abstract ideas to concrete designs, but thinking about the more tangible considerations helped me narrow down my ideas and give me a more defined goal and purpose. Referring back to my research on sites with similar themes also highlighted areas that I needed to work on, such as differentiating my project more strongly from existing sites.</p>
                <p>During this process, I incorporated some of the information I learned during my user research as well.Though I stayed close to my original idea of supplying seasonality by location, my planned implementation changed from what I had originally invisioned. I kept the central idea of searching for produce and providing the seasonality, and added on the possibility of viewing alternatives and other useful statistics about the produce items. In addition, while researching food labels, as mentioned by some of the people I interviewed, I noticed that it was hard to find a consolidated source of information on labels. I also could only find information in the form of articles about the label, which aren't helpful for people in a hurry. So, I shifted my focus to also include a resource for entering or scanning the information and recieving a report on the signifance of the labels.</p>
