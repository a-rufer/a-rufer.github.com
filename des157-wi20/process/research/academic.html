                <h2>Academic Research Summary</h2>

                <p>For my academic research, I consumed several sources of information, including a TED Talk, some articles, and a website somewhat similar to what I am planning to create. My first source was a TED Talk called &quot;Paper Beats Plastic? How to Rethink Environmental Folklore&quot;, which debunked some environmental folklore and provided an informative overview of some systemic problems facing the world in terms of the environment and how design-led system change can help resolve these issues. One of the main ideas was that everything comes from nature at some point in its life cycle, so the concept of eco-materials is rather inaccurate. The real environmental impact of any product is more about how it is used, rather than what it is. This is shown in life cycle analysis (LCA) of products, which take into consideration the life of a product from the extraction of raw materials through its end of life, and all of the associated impacts. The speaker emphasized creating closed loop systems, where the entire life cycle is considered and designed for, and bringing about widespread system change through design at this stage. This design-led change could take a variety of forms, from improving products to eliminating person-product failure. A striking detail of the presentation relevant to my own project was that 40% of food bought for homes in the US is wasted.</p>

                <p>The article &quot;Environmental Cost of Shipping Groceries Around the World&quot; provided a more narrow view into my topic. It showed data to reinforce the ideas that I already knew and gave me a more detailed perspective. In general, the article explained how the global network of food transportation works in the modern world, and how this increasing rate affects the carbon footprint of the food we consume. A proposed solution to the increasing carbon footprint is to find a way to make people pay for the environmental cost of transportation, such as through taxation or by including freight transports in the EU in the emissions-trading program. Another approach is by educating consumers, for example by labeling products with their carbon footprint, or by improving transportation networks to minimize time and pollution. The growing carbon footprint of the food sector in general is generated partly from transportation emissions, but also by refrigeration of perishable goods and their packaging. In addition, even for more locally grown food, if it is out of season, the refrigeration and preservation of the food may incur enough emissions to exceed those from transportation. Despite the proposed measures, a substantial obstacle is that consumers expect and are accustomed to access to cheap food regardless of seasonality, meaning that for meaningful change, consumer attitudes must change as well.</p>

                <p>The last main source I used for research was a website that informs users about what produce is in season according to the location that users input into the site. Users can select the US state and time of year than they would like to see the in-season produce for, and the site returns a list of produce that is in season according to those parameters. I found this site to be helpful, but that it could be improved upon by including more information and making it more user friendly for users to search for specific produce items, rather than scanning through the list to see if an item is in season or not or by searching through a drop-down menu. It seems like a valuable resource for obtaining information to use in order to implement my project and as a great example of an direction I could take my project in, though I would likely need to do more in depth research in order to realize the specifications of my project.</p>

                <p>Other articles provided information about the various benefits of in season produce, such as their nutritional content, quality, price, and environmental impact. One article debated the myth of food miles, showing that though transportation of food is an important consideration, it is not the final word in which sources are the most environmentally friendly, since the situation is much more complex than simply distance traveled. I hope to mitigate the problems presented in that article by not just providing data on distance traveled, but also on seasonality and local providers.</p>
