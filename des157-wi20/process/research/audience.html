                            <li>Also hard to know if you’re actually making the right choice because there’s so many different influences on the environmental impact of a single item</li>

                    <li>Cheaper to buy in bulk, but hard to use it all up

                                </ul>
                            </li>

                <h2>User Research Summary</h2>

                <p>The interview process showed me different perspectives, especially about which factors and problems people thought were most important in the realm of grocery shopping. A lot of the problems dealt with lack of information in some form; there were problems with general knowledge, finding the time and sources to use for research, and having incomplete, badly designed, or otherwise unuseful information or labelling. For people concerned with the price of produce, a significant issue was the balance of price and environmental impact of the product. There were also more tangible problems related to price, such as buying in bulk to spend less money, but having the food go bad before having the opportunity to use it all. Previously, I was more oriented towards seasonality and geographic origins of produce, and how that knowledge could better inform consumers and their choice of produce. However, the people I interviewed enumerated some less abstract problems, though many still related to the information available to consumers. A lot of these problems are related to waste in some form, such as waste in the form of disposable packaging, excessive packaging, or food waste in stores and in homes. So, it would be relevant to broaden the scope of information I use, or perhaps shift my focus towards providing a more interactive, helpful project that could help people while they are actually at the store trying to make decisions, in addition to just at home. For example, I could maybe make an interactive guide to labelling systems, to make deciphering complex labels easier to understand and evaluate.</p>
