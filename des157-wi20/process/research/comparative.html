                <p>This website takes in user input on the user's activities that affect their CO2 production in order to estimate their carbon footprint. In addition to just calculating current usage, it also provides ways to reduce the user's carbon footprint and calculates by how much those actions would reduce their footprint.</p>

                <p>Overall, I found that the website was clear and easy to use. One problem I noticed is that some of the data to enter was difficult to estimate, making it hard to get an accurate result. For example, average distance driven per year is not something I passively know. But there was an option to do it by week instead of by year, which made it easier to estimate and more user-friendly. A shortcoming of the results themselves is that they didn't seem as accurate as they could be, since it had fewer, less comprehensive factors to enter in order to calculate the footprint than other carbon footprint calculators. The UI of this website was clearer than some other carbon footprint calculator websites, but it seems that it sacrificed some accuracy of the calculations in order to achieve this. As a whole, however, despite this potential inaccuracy, this website would still have a strong impact, especially in terms of motivating users to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. In terms of effectively sparking action from the user, which seems to be a goal of the website, this simpler UI is possibly more important than the accuracy lost, since users who are frustrated or bored are unlikely to complete the assessment, and thus less likely to take action. In addition, while other websites had lists of possible actions or links to ways to reduce you footprint, none of them provided concrete data on how much it would reduce your footprint by, as this one does. And, by entering the degree to which they would implement these methods, the user receives concrete, measurable effects of those potential actions. This is more motivating, as well as serving like a commitment to actually taking action. Lastly, it is convenient to see the ongoing calculation in the sidebar, which makes it seem like less of a black box.</p>
                
                <p>The interactivity consisted mostly of navigating through the pages of "Home Energy", "Transportation", and "Waste", and entering data through input boxes, drop-down menus, and checkboxes. In addition, there were symbols at the end of every entry that could be clicked on to provide a short description of its relevance and where to find more. I found that this way of imparting information was very effective in its unobtrusiveness, yet clear accessibility through the recognizable symbol. A minor irritating detail to this function, however, is that to close the popup box, the user must click on the 'x' rather than just clicking on the symbol again. </p>

                <a id="cited2" href="#citation2">[2]</a>
                
                <p>AllSides is a news website that provides information about the media bias of the articles in it. The articles are linked from actual news sources and are rated according to their bias (left, right, center). It also provides information about media bias, how its ratings are calculated, tools to rate your own bias and vote on the bias of news sources, and other related resources. Its goal is to remove the filter bubble that people find themselves in that only confirms their existing beliefs by providing news from across the political spectrum and providing information on their biases.</p>
                <p>This website did not provide much interactivity in terms of collecting information from users, since it is primarily a news website. It does provide an option to log in, though. Its tool for rating your own bias is clear and self-explanatory, with sliders for leanings that visually relate to the type of information being entered. However, the mechanics of how the form works is a bit awkward, since the items are laid out as if they are a gradient though they are actually discrete positions. So, this might be better implemented through radio buttons. </p>
                <p>Another interactive feature of the website is filtering media bias ratings of news sources. It is a useful feature and its usage is clear, but it is irritating to use; every time a checkbox is checked or unchecked, the page reloads itself and performs a sliding animation down to the part of the page with the filter that the user was at previously. This is especially irksome when trying to change multiple criteria in the filter, since for every criterion, the user must wait for the page to reload and auto-scroll back down.</p>
                <p>AllSides also provides many paths to reach content. Users can browse from the homepage, which looks like a normal news site, but instead of simply being a news article, each article has a short blurb and links to the subject's coverage in 3 different websites with right, left, and center political bias. Users can also choose a specific topic to search by, and recieve a list of articles about that topic sorted into categories of left, right, and center bias. In addition, users can simply search the website in a search bar, which gives the user results from inside the website as well as sorted news articles. As a whole, though its presentation may not be as refined, it provides the functionality of a typical news website, with additional features of using external articles with bias ratings and providing resources and interactive assessments to better evaluate the user's and the media's bias. </p>
