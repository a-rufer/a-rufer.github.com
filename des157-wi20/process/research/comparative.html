                <p>This website takes in user input on the user's activities that affect their CO2 production in order to estimate their carbon footprint. In addition to just calculating current usage, it also provides ways to reduce your carbon footprint and calculates by how much those actions would reduce your footprint.</p>
                <p>Overall, I found that the website was clear and easy to use. One problem I had with it was that some of the statistics to enter were difficult to estimate, making it hard to get an accurate result. For example average distance driven per year is not something I passively know, but there was the option to do it by week instead of by year which made it easier to estimate. A shortcoming of the results themselves is that they didn't seem as accurate as they could be. The UI of this website was clearer than some other carbon footprint calculator websites I looked up, but I think it sacrificed some accuracy of the calculations for a simpler UI since they had fewer factors to enter in order to calculate the footprint. However, as a whole I think that despite this potential inaccuracy, this website would have a strong impact, especially in terms of motivating users to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. While other websites had lists of possible actions or links to ways to reduce you footprint, none of them provided concrete data on how much it would reduce your footprint by. In addition, by having users enter the degree to which they would implement these methods gives them actions to take with tangible effects, which is more motivating, as well as seeming almost like a commitment to taking the actions already. It was also convenient to have the ongoing calculation in the side bar, which makes it seem like less of a black box.</p>
                
                <p>The interactivity consisted mostly of navigating through the pages of "Home Energy", "Transportation", and "Waste", and entering data on the users actions through input boxes, drop-down menus, and checkboxes. In addition, there were symbols at the end of every entry that could be clicked on to provide a short description of its relevance and where to find more. I found that this way of imparting information was very effective in its unobtrusiveness, yet clearly accessible through the recognizable information symbol.</p>

                <p>AllSides is a news website that provides information about the media bias of the articles in it. The articles are linked from actual news sources and are rated according to their bias (left, right, center). It also provides information about media bias, how its ratings are calculated, tools to rate your own bias and vote on the bias of news sources, and other related resources. Its goal is to remove the filter bubble that people find themselves in that only confirms their existing beliefs by providing news from across the political spectrum and providing information on their biases</p>
                <p>This website did not provide much interactivity in terms of collecting information from users, since it is primarily a news website. It does provide an option to log in, though. Its tool for rating your own bias is clear and self-explanatory, with sliders for leanings that visually relate to the type of information being entered. However, the mechanics of how the form works is a bit awkward, since the items are laid out as if they are a gradient though they are actually discrete positions. So, this might be better implemented through radio buttons. </p>
                <p>Another interactive feature of the wesite is filtering media bias ratings of news sources. It is a useful feature and its usage is clear, but it is irritating to use; every time a checkbox is checked or unchecked, the page reloads itself and performs a sliding animation down to the part of the page with the filter that the user was at previously. This is especially irksome when trying to change multiple criteria in the filter, since for every criterion, the user must wait for the page to reload and auto-scroll back down.</p>
