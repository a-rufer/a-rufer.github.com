                    <p>This website takes in user input on their activities that affect their CO2 production in order to estimate their carbon footprint. In addition to just calculating current usage, it also provides ways to reduce your carbon footprint and calculates by how much those actions would reduce your footprint.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I found that the website was clear and easy to use. One problem I had with it was that some of the statistcs to enter were difficult to estimate, such as average distance driven, but there was the option to do it by week instead of by year which made it easier to use. A shortcoming of the results themselves is that they didn't seem as accurate as they could be. The UI of this website was clearer than some other carbon footprint calculator websites I looked up, but I think they sacrificed some accuracy of the calculations for a simpler UI. However, as a whole I think this website, despite that potential inaccuracy, this website would have a strong impact, especially in terms of motivating users to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. While other websites had lists of possible actions or links to ways to reduce you footprint, none of them provided concrete data on how much it would reduce your footprint by. In addition, by having users enter the degree to which they would implement these methods gives them actions to take with tangible effects, which is more motivating, as well as seeming almost like a commitment to taking the actions already. It was also convenient to have the ongoing calculation in the side bar, which makes it seem like less of a black box.</p>
                    <p>The interactivity consisted mostly of navigating through the pages of "Home Energy", "Transportation", and "Waste", and entering data on the users action through input boxes, drop-down options, and checkboxes. In addition, there were symbols at the end of every entry that could be clicked on to provide a short description of its relevance and where to find more. I found that this way of imparting information was very effective in its unobtrusiveness, yet clearly accessible through the recognizable information symbol</p>
